            <p>
              I have over 20 years of experience in building websites and web
              applications, working independently and in teams for a wide range
              of companies and organizations. I enjoy all facets of the
              development process, from brainstorming solutions to challenges,
              collaborating with product and design, building new features and
              web applications, and optimizing user experience and making it
              accessible to all.
            </p>

              I began my web development career as a client-side web developer,
              but spent the last six years building both client-side and
              server-side web applications.

            <p>
              I have a great love for our natural resources, and most of my
              hobbies revolve around that. You can frequently find me hiking or
              bicycling in any number of beautiful areas the Bay Area has to
              offer. I spent five years volunteering for the Gulf of the
              Farallones National Marine Sanctuary doing beach surveys and
              docent work. I've also organized group volunteer efforts with the
              Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than the outdoors, I love spending time with my family and
              friends. I play a little guitar, piano and violin, and love to
              sing. I love to read and am always working through a couple of
              books at a time.
